<!-- ## Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep Learning

**2nd Edition - ICLR 2026**

### Overview

The second edition of the Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep Learning will be held at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2026.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds to explore rigorous, scientific approaches to understanding deep learning systems. We seek contributions that apply systematic methodologies, empirical investigations, and theoretical frameworks to demystify how and why deep learning works.

### Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on (but not limited to):
- Theoretical foundations of deep learning
- Empirical studies of neural network behavior
- Mechanistic interpretability
- Scaling laws and emergent phenomena
- Optimization dynamics and loss landscapes
- Generalization and robustness
- Feature learning and representation quality
- Scientific methodology for ML research

### Important Dates

**Coming soon!** Check back for submission deadlines and workshop dates.

### Organizers

Information about the organizing committee will be announced soon. -->
